# entries with minplayers -1 are "banned"
# and can't be voted in even with map_restrict 0
# use this for really awful maps that are bundled into a pk3 with others
# or if you don't want to delete their pk3's for some reason
# or a map incorrectly claims to support a mode that it doesn't
# (e.g. specifies CTF but doesn't actually have flags)
